## What's the point?
* NOTE: This chapter assumes that you are NOT a collaborator and can only contribute through pull requests.  If you are a collaborator, you do not need to fork the app.
* The Ruby on Racetracks elements (such as scripts and certain gems) are essential for me.  However, the people in charge of a project may consider these elements unnecessary and want to keep them out of the master branch of the repository.
* This chapter explains how to provide the Ruby on Racetracks elements for yourself while keeping them OUT of the pull requests you make.

## The Usual Forking Procedure
* To contribute to an app when you are NOT a collaborator, you fork the app, create a branch for your changes, and submit your branch in a pull request.
* This procedure does NOT address how to save elements for yourself while keeping them out of pull requests.

## What To Do Now
* Go to the Rails app's main source code page on GitLab/BitBucket/GitHub.  Let's call this app other_user/project1.  Do NOT git clone the source code.
* Fork this app.  Let's call this app your_username/project1.
* Go to the main source code page of your fork your_username/project1.
* Start a Docker container from the Rails app's custom Docker image.  In the /home/winner/shared directory, use the "git clone" command to download the Rails app.  You now have the master branch of your_username/project1.
* Enter the root directory.  Enter the command "git remote -v".  The URL printed should be that of YOUR fork of the source code and NOT that of the mainline version.

## What To Do Later
* NOTE: Don't start on the actions in this section just yet.  You will be implementing them in later chapters and units.
* In your fork, keep the master branch the same as the master branch of the main app.
* In your fork, you will create the branch ruby_on_racetracks and add the Ruby on Racetracks elements there.  (The rest of Unit 2 covers this.)  Git add, commit, and push these changes.  (Be prepared to update this branch periodically from your fork's master branch.)
* From the ruby_on_racetracks branch, start a new branch new_feature.
* In the new_feature branch, make the necessary changes.  Git add, commit, and push these changes.
* Enter the command "git log" and record the commit numbers of just the commits pertaining to the new feature.
* Enter the command "git checkout master; git checkout -b pr_new_feature".  (In other words, just add "pr_" to the beginning of the name of the branch of your new feature.)
* Use the "git cherry-pick" command to select the changes from the new_feature branch you wish to add to the pr_new_feature branch.
* Run the git_check.sh script to make sure you've covered all your bases.  When you have, make a pull request for your pr_new_feature branch.
