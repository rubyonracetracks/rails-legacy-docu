In this chapter, you will give yourself an overview of the test suite.

## MiniTest vs. RSpec vs. Cucumber
Take note of whether the test suite is MiniTest, RSpec, Cucumber, or some combination.

## Time Needed to Run Tests
How long does it take to run the test suite?  You may need to work on speeding up the test suite.

## Outlining
* Run the outline.sh script to generate block diagrams and outlines of your app in the log directory.  These block diagrams and outlines allow you to see at a glance how the app is organized.
* If the outline.sh script fails for certain models, you'll have to fix them.

## User Experience
* Run the app on the local server, and log into it as a user.
* Try out the app and familiarize yourself with what the user experiences.
