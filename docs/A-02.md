## Back Story
* The [Ruby.MN](https://www.meetup.com/ruby-mn/) group had a web site that listed sponsors and allowed users to post a "for hire" profile, projects, and job openings.
* The old Ruby.MN site was was retired in early 2018 due to concerns about security vulnerabilities.
* The old Ruby.MN site was first created on GitHub in 2006, during the very early days of Ruby on Rails and before the Devise gem and integration tests were available.  At the time it was retired, it was still in Rails 3.2.
* I used my [Generic App gem](https://www.genericapp.net/) to create a new site with the Devise gem for authentication and with integration tests.
* The new Ruby.MN site is at https://rubymn2.herokuapp.com/.

## Setup
* If you have not already done so, install Docker on your machine.  More details are covered in the [Different Docker Tutorial](https://www.differentdockertutorial.com/).
* Enter the following commands in LXTerminal:
```
cd
mkdir jhsu802701
cd jhsu802701
git clone https://gitlab.com/jhsu802701/docker-debian-stretch
cd docker-debian-stretch
sh rails-rubymn2.sh
```
* When prompted for a port offset value, enter "12".
* Enter the command "cd rails-rubymn2; sh download_new_image.sh" and follow the instructions.
* It will take a few minutes to download the Docker image.  When the process is finished, a Docker container will be created for you, and you will be automatically logged in.
* In Docker, enter the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/jhsu802701/rubymn2
cd rubymn2
sh build_fast.sh
```
* While you wait for the build process to be completed, start a second tab for accessing the new Ruby.MN app:
  * Open a second tab in LXTerminal.  Enter the command "sh join.sh".
  * In the second tab, enter the following commands:
  ```
  cd rubymn2
  sh credentials.sh
  ```
  * When prompted, enter your Git email address and Git name.  (You can press Ctrl-C to skip logging into Heroku.)
  * In a few minutes, the build process will be finished, and you will see the Rails server running in your first tab.  Go to http://localhost:3012/ to view the app.
