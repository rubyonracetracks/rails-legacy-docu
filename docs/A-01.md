## Back Story
* During the warmer months of the year, trees need water to survive and grow.  Long periods without rain can stress the trees.  On the [Adopt-A-Tree](http://adoptatree.brewingabetterforest.com/) web site, users can sign up to water trees in their neighborhoods during the growing season.
* I found out about the Adopt-A-Tree app through the group [Open Twin Cities](http://www.opentwincities.org/), which builds and maintains this app for Minneapolis.
* As a collaborator, I added my Ruby on Racetracks elements to this app.  I also upgraded the Ruby version from 2.2 to 2.6 and the Rails version from 4.1 to 5.2.

## Setup
* If you have not already done so, install Docker on your machine.  More details are covered in the [Different Docker Tutorial](https://www.differentdockertutorial.com/).
* Enter the following commands in LXTerminal:
```
cd
mkdir OpenTwinCities
cd OpenTwinCities
git clone https://github.com/OpenTwinCities/docker-debian-stretch.git
cd docker-debian-stretch
sh rails-adoptatree.sh
```
* When prompted for a port offset value, enter "11".
* Enter the command "cd rails-adoptatree; sh download_new_image.sh" and follow the instructions.
* It will take a few minutes to download the Docker image.  When the process is finished, a Docker container will be created for you, and you will be automatically logged in.
* In Docker, enter the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/OpenTwinCities/adopt-a-tree.git
cd adopt-a-tree
sh build_fast.sh
```
* While you wait for the build process to be completed, start a second tab for accessing Adopt-A-Tree:
  * Open a second tab in LXTerminal.  Enter the command "sh join.sh".
  * In the second tab, enter the following commands:
  ```
  cd adopt-a-tree
  sh credentials.sh
  ```
  * When prompted, enter your Git email address and name.
* In a few minutes, the build process will be finished, and you will see the Rails server running in your first tab.  Go to http://localhost:3011/ to view the app.
