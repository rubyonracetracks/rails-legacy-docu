Add additional tests.  The test coverage report provided by SimpleCov will show you lib actions, jobs, and other parts of the code that may need test coverage.

## Tests to Add
* For every lib action in the lib directory, there should be tests for each one (in spec/lib, test/lib, or in an integration test of consolidated lib action tests).
* Each time you add a set of lib action tests and get them to pass, git add/commit/push your changes.
