In this chapter, you will add integration tests to the app.  From exploring the app as a user, you should be familiar of what the app currently does.

## Static Page Tests
If there aren't already integration tests of the static pages, add them.  These should be quite simple.

## Login Tests
If there aren't already integration tests of the login process, add them.  These should be quite simple.

## Other Integration Tests
* If there aren't already integration tests of the things the app currently can do, add them.
