## What's the point?
Every time you reset your Docker container, your Git credentials are lost.  When you run the credentials.sh script, all you have to do is enter your email address and name.  You don't have to remember the Git commands for doing so.

## Git Branch
In the root directory of your fork of the source code, enter the following command:
```
git checkout -b ruby_on_racetracks
```

## Rails Neutrino Source Code
* Go to the <a href="https://www.railsneutrino.com/">Rails Neutrino</a> page.  Click on "Git", and follow the link to the Rails Neutrino source code on GitLab for creating new Rails apps.
* Use the "git clone" command to download the source code from GitLab.
* There's no need to run any of the Rails Neutrino build scripts.  You are using the Rails Neutrino source code as a giant cheat sheet.

## Procedure
* Copy the credentials.sh script from the root directory of the Rails Neutrino source code to the root directory of the Rails app that you are working on.
* From the root directory of the Rails app, enter the command "sh credentials.sh".  When prompted, enter your email address and your name.
* Enter the following commands:
```
git add .
git commit -m "Added the credentials.sh script"
git push origin ruby_on_racetracks
```
