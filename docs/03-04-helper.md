In this chapter, you will add helper tests to the app.

## Title Helper
If there isn't already a title helper in the app, you should provide one and then use it in views.  The Raile Neutrino repository shows how to do this.
* Title checking is a great tool in certain integration tests, especially those that involve redirection.

## Other Helper Tests
* If there are any helpers in the app/helpers directory, be sure to provide tests for them.
* When you are finished, enter the command "sh git_check.sh".
* If all goes well, you are ready to move on.  Enter the following commands:
```
git add .
git commit -m "Added helper tests"
git push origin master
```
