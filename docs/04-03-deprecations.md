## What's the Point?
* As you ran the tests, you may have seen messages warning about deprecations.
* The app may pass all tests now, but the deprecations warn you of future breakages if you don't make the updates and upgrades needed.

## Procedure
* Make the changes suggested, and run the git_check.sh script to see if they pan out.  If everything checks out, you are ready to git add/commit/push your changes and move on to the next issue.
* If you need to upgrade gems, run the upgrade_gems.sh script.  If everything checks out, you are ready to git add/commit/push your changes and move on to the next issue.
